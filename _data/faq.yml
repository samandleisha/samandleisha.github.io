  answer: |
    If using Apple Maps, follow directions to <a target="_blank" href="https://maps.apple.com/?address=601%20S%20Meridian%20St,%20FL%204,%20Indianapolis,%20IN%20%2046225,%20United%20States&auid=4856027464962719554&ll=39.758692,-86.158185&lsp=9902&q=Cinderwood%20Event%20Center&t=m">Cinderwood</a>.

    If using Google Maps (and parking), follow directions to <a target="_blank" href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/xwKmFh7RMZnov6Ho9">the parking lot next to Cinderwood</a>.

    If using another navigation service, I like you style. But also, you're going to have to figure it out yourself.
